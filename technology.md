# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis

Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python using a Jupyter notebook and Pandas.

## Database Storage

We intend to use a Postgres SQL database to store the data.

## Machine Learning

SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a linear regression model to predict insurance charges. Our training and testing setup is splitting the dataset 80/20 with 80% for training and 20% for testing.

## Dashboard

We will use Tableau to create a dashboard and Google Slides for a presentation, bringing in our dataset from the Postgres SQL database.
