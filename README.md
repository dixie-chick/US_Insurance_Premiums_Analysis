# US_Insurance_Premiums_Analysis
With US Health Insurance more complex than ever, digital tranformation to make predictions based on input can deliver more clear results to predict potential candidacy. This dataset uses Age, Sex, BMI, Number of Children, Smoker and Region using Linear Regression to create a machine learning model. 

## What is the story? 
Would they be a liability to our insurance company or would they be a good candidate to our insurance company? Is this a good insurance candidate/customer? 

## Data Used:

## Assumptions
A BMI of less than 18.5 means that a person is underweight. A BMI of between 18.5 and 24.9 is ideal. A BMI of between 25 and 29.9 is overweight. A BMI over 30 indicates obesity.
Overweight: 26–37%
Obesity: 38% or more
Activity level: Male body type
Acceptable: 18–25%

## Process:
- exploratory data analysis in pandas using Jupyter notebook
- testing and training the data
- create linear regression model
- train the model 


## Foundations Segment 1
- Decide on a topic for the project—think of a question that can be answered using data.
- Create a repository for the project and invite the other team members to join.
- Source a dataset that will suit your needs (you can even use multiple datasets if applicable).
- Begin to clean, organize, and perform exploratory data analysis on your datasets so that they're ready for analysis.
- Include mockups of a machine learning model and a database.
