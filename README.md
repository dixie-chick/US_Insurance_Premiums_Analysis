- train the model 


## Foundations Segment 1
- Decide on a topic for the projectâ€”think of a question that can be answered using data.
- Create a repository for the project and invite the other team members to join.
- Source a dataset that will suit your needs (you can even use multiple datasets if applicable).
- Begin to clean, organize, and perform exploratory data analysis on your datasets so that they're ready for analysis.
- Include mockups of a machine learning model and a database.
